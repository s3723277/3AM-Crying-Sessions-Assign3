            <p> The project began through a series of brainstorming with the whole group, Hoang suggested that we make an app that would help the elders use their phones.We were planning to create a mobile application, but due to our inexperience with mobile
                app development we decided to make a website instead. With the use of the mobile jquery plugin, we were able to simulate an app through our website.

            <h1> Exteded Viable Features</h1>
            <h2>EVF1 - Speech-to-text
            </h2>
            <p>Montgomery - "I just want to be able to be able to send messages to my friends and work colleagues without having to type myself due to my extremely large hands "

            </p>
            <p>Background - Old and fragile - Has Parkinson's disease - Business owner</p>
            <p> Needs and Goals - Needs to communicate with employees - Minimise use of fingers</p>
            <p> Skills and Experience - Brief knowledge on technology Has used typed writers and keyboards and isn't a big fan</p>
            <h3>Context Scenario</h3>
            <p>Montgomery Burns has some very weak and fragile fingers and struggles to type with his big hands on such a small screen. Mr Burns can ask BLS to type in a particular thing or ask BLS how to do a particular task. Mr Burns wants to go onto viber
                and send his assistant a picture of his new fur vest. He says "Hey Boomer Life Support, help me send a photo to Smithers." BLS opens up viber to Smithers and asks him which photo he would like to send. Mr Burns selects the first one and
                sends it to Smithers. While Mr Burns has noticed its difficult to type, his eye sight has also managed to deteriorate over time due to old age. He believes that if he were to minimise reading, it would reduce strain on his eyes, and prolong
                his eyesight at a certain level. Mr Burns notices that while he has been using the text-to-speech function on BLS, he can actually reverse the functionality of the feature, and have it speech-to-text! So instead of Mr Burns having to try
                and read the tips, he can have them be read out to him! Mr Burns is super thankful, and now has placed Boomer Life Support as his number 1 app on his phone. Validation: Text-to-speech has become something of the norm now with the increased
                volume of AI software being developed. Something as popular as Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant ensure that speech-to-text can be possible

            </p>
            <h2>EVF2 - Conversion Starter
            </h2>
            <p>Hans - "Ever since I've been in this retirement home, I've been so lonely. Nobody comes and visits me due to the lockdown restrictions in place at the moment, I wish there was someone i could at least try and talk to, or just keep me engaged!"

                <p>Background - Lives alone - Doesn't have many friends as he is old, and most have passed away</p>
                <p> Needs and goals - Someone to talk to - Something to keep engaged / hobby</p>
                <p>Skills and experiences - Little tech knowledge. Knows the bare minimum - Communicates to family through occasional texts. Busy family, limited responses </p>

            </p>
            <h3>Context Scenario</h3>
            <p> Hans Moleman often finds himself a bit lonely in the retirement home. Hans pulls out his iPad and opens up BLS. Hans selects the virtual conversation starter. By selecting the chatbot, Hans can talk to the chatbot which will interact with
                him using the inbuilt AI. Hans tells the chatbot about the time he got hit by a football. Hans no longer feels as lonely and is comforted by the company provided by BLS. RiRi has now given him a new found look on the meaning of friendship
                and is appreciative that Boomer Life Support can help stimulate him whilst in the retirement room. I think I even heard Hans say that he prefers talking to RiRi over his daughter... Validation: Chatbot's are already developed out there,
                and therefore we can always design our own chatbot through Java

            </p>
            <h2>EVF3 - Large icons and features
            </h2>
            <p>Large icons allows for people with larger features to access buttons easier without needing to wear glasses and take ages to select something and eliminate the ability to accidentally press other buttons.
            </p>
            <h3>User story</h3>
            <p>Gary Fu has extremely large fingers and low eyesight, he gets progressively more frustrated as he continues to try to press friend requests on facebook but clicks on the marketplace at the same time. He manages to go into the settings and
                change the icons so that they are larger and he doesn't click on two buttons at once now. Life is good.
            </p>
            <h2>EVF4 - Game Implementation
            </h2>
            <p>We can try and implement a game that helps keep them acknowledging functions and features they just learnt within the app. Implementing a game will help activate certain parts of their brain that could help them remember more. Examples being
                a game like go fish, helps with memory, but instead of matching the same pictures, it would match a definition or function they learnt with the meaning behind it. E.g. match friend requests with 'this is where you go to accept or send
                requests to people you want to be friends with.
            </p>
            <h3>User story</h3>
            <p>Alfred Pennyworth likes to stay on top of his knowledge of technology. He wants to test his knowledge of modern day apps and tasks. Alfred decides to open up BLS and open up the quiz screen- here, Alfred is tested on his knowledge on keywords
                or tasks surrounding the things he learnt with the use of BLS. Alfred is kept busy while his partner sleeps through the day. Alfred is recapping his knowledge in quizzes, crossword puzzles and word-finds while he waits for his partner
                to wake up.
            </p>
            <h2>EVF5 - Magnifier zoom
            </h2>
            <p>Having a magnifier zoom allows for elderly people who struggle to see text/images from a far distance allows for them to adjust and focus on a specific item they wish to see.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>The Guy from UP - "I'd love to learn about technology, I've always been a fan of learning in general! However, I've always struggled to remember new concepts. If only there was a way to remind me... "</p>
            <p> Background - Old and is forgetful - Was a previous scholar - Loves to watch movies.. - Likes being reminded of efforts</p>

            <h3>Context Scenario</h3>
            <p> Since the guy From UP lost his wife, he has forgotten to take his medication. With BLS, however, he can now log his medication in and the app will remind him when to take it. The guy is prescribed to take Panadol twice a day after the food.
                So The guy goes into BLS and setups the reminders to remind him to take Panadol at 12PM and 8PM. Whilst Boomer Life Support is available to remind you of everyday life features, it also encourages you to remember your new learnt concepts
                and commend you on your efforts! The guy from UP has recently learnt how to make status updates on WhatsApp. He found BLS super helpful in teaching him, but he's worried he'll forget what it was that he learnt. So the guy from UP decides
                to set up daily reminders of his achievements for the day! Now, every 8 hours (you may set it to however often you like) he gets reminded that to make a status on WhatsApp, all he has to do was click either the photo button on the status
                page to upload a picture, or click on the pencil button to post a written message! To get more information in regards to the feature, all you have to do is click the notification, and you'll be taken back to a refresher page! Validation:
                Apps similar to the reminder app on iPhone and calendar reminders</p>




            <h1 class="display-5"> Scope Creep: </h1>
            <br>
            <p> Relating to our scope, we had an issue with developing an app, so we had to settle with a website version. If we had the time, we would develop the prototype into an app since we believe it would be useful for the elderly.

                to finish their assigned tasks. We ended up having to delay some of the tasks due to the amount of work required by other classes, but in the end we ended up doing really well.

            </p>
            <h1 class="display-5"> Testing: </h1>
            <br>
            <p> Unfortunately our first idea was to create an app, but midway we understood that this was really difficult to achieve so we changed our idea to a website.If we had more time we would definitely try and research more and find out how to create
                a working app hence that was our main idea.

                    <br> We use Trello to organize our project and share any important links that might be useful for our research. Trello has useful features such as checklists and labelling so each member knows what they’re working on, and figure out
                    how long they have till the due date of each part of the project. </p>
                <h3>GitHub <br> (<a href="https://github.com/Melanie-Lok/3AM-Crying-Sessions" target=_blank> Link </a> ) </h3>
                <p>Github is a free tools tool that helps with the version control of our website’s development. This ensures that we are up-to-date with all our progress, and gives us a back-up of our previous versions in case we run into any issues through
                    our development.
                    <br>
                    <br> Our group decided to use Github because we were introduced to it in our intro to IT class so we are aware of its features, and we are able to use it without having any issues. Most developers also use github so it is easy to troubleshoot
                    any problems that we might face. </p>
                <h3>AWS (Amazon Web Services) <br> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/"> Link </a> ) </h3>

                    <br>
                    <br> We will use the latest AWS version because RMIT provided us with it for free and we also used it last semester so we know how to handle it.(write more later can't think anything else) </p>
                <h3>Google Docs <br> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6z4rxA1-ygBL7oHkDkfnElnYfD3yw-sSj-rcwiJDM4/edit" target=_blank> Link </a> ) </h3>

                    <br>
                    <br> We decided to use google docs because we have used it in many assignments before and by now we know how to use it and its features, and also because it is very easy and very simple. We can work on something all together at the
                    same time and make edits without affecting someone else’s work. </p>
                <h3>Google Sheets <br> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ICg6NZZE9kWygKP4TbVyk0f7gCAZ3-GPklJrfls7cc4/edit#gid=1115838130" target=_blank> Link </a> ) </h3>

                <h3> Discord <br> (<a href="https://discord.com/new" target=_blank> Link </a>) </h3>
                <p>Discord is a free app that was firstly created for gamers and one person would host a server and people could join and all communicate at the same time. Nowadays discord is used not only for gaming but for other many reasons as well, for
                    example creating a project with a team.
                    <br>
                    <br> We use discord because as a team we think it is very easy to use and since everyone used it before hand we always have it opened and check messages/updates daily. Discord has a feature where you can add bots in servers and they
                    can do multiple things. For example remind you for specific dates, record meetings, or even play music.
                </p>
                <h2>Software</h2>
                <h3>Eclipse IDE <br> (<a href=" https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/" target=_blank> Link</a>) </h3>
                <p>Eclipse IDE is a free open-source software that would be useful in coding in Java. There is also an extension “marketplace” in which users may find useful plugins that may better their experience. It also has an error detection system
                    in which the program would indicate visible errors, and stop the program from running.
                    <br>
                    <br> We decided to use this software because most of us have either taken the classes Intro to Programming or Programming 1, meaning we have basic java knowledge. It is also easier to code mobile applications in Java rather than any
                    other languages. </p>
                <h2>Tools</h2>
                <h3>Visual Studio Code <br> (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/%22%3Ehttps://code.visualstudio.com/" target=_blank> Link </a>) </h3>
                <p>Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor created by microsoft, with features such as a marketplace, embedded gits and autocompletion of a piece of code.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>We decided to use Visual Studio Code because we all have used it before in previous subjects and we are experienced with its features. It is accessible by most operating system (Windows, Linux, and MacOS) which ensures that all of
                        our members are able to access it without having to worry about the compatibility of their devices. The marketplace also gave us an advantage, especially with the online server and HTML preview, making it easier to edit our HTML
                        files. We downloaded the latest version and the tool itself is free.</p>
                    <h3>Figma <br> (<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/vSydl66F0z8fp2YmbrLQZg/BIS-A2?node-id=0%3A1" target=_blank> Link </a>)</h3>
                    <p>Figma is a software/website focusing on vector graphics editing, and mostly for prototyping websites/apps due to it being able to setup interactivity for elements such as buttons to give life to the prototype.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Figma heavily influenced the efficiency of our diagrams and prototype, as it is easy to organize elements such as shapes and letters as you can name the elements to their corresponding type. Similarly, Figma allows us to collaborate
                        within prototypes in real time, combined with MS Teams or Discord, we are able to collaborate in real time and figure out if there are any conflicts with the ideas of each member.</p>
