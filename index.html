                <td>Being born in Melbourne, it was inevitable that I would be influenced by our indie culture so from a young age I loved playing strange online games. Having spent so much time on a computer, I was always messing with my dad’s computer,
                    even if it meant that I would accidentally delete his important files and introduce viruses. Eventually he bought me my own huge, white, boxy PC but only allowed me to play educational games he purchased on CDs. Despite this limitation,
                    my interest in IT only grew. As I grew up, I realised there was more to IT than games, so I pursued this interest which now led me to take a strong interest in UX/UI. </td>
