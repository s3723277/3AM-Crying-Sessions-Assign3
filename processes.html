       <h1>Project Processes</h1>
       <p>
        The key thing in group projects and teamwork is communication. 
        Communication is important in any type of cooperation and cohesion. 
        Our group communicated very well to one another, we have formed a friendly bond beyond the standard group relationships and this has therefore enabled us to work harder for one another. 
        Our group is open and welcoming to all and any forms of communication including feedback, planning and sharing. 
        The thing that hasn't worked well can sometimes be our time management. 
        As a group, we have had other commitments and sometimes the project would have to be put towards the backend of our priorities. 
        However, we still managed to work on it together in calls and meetings and worked together to progress the project and workload to completion. 
        However, we were still able to work on the project, chipping away at it weekly. 
        <br><br>
        Our mentor Trevor provided us with a lot of useful feedback, tips and guidance that helped us progress and develop our project into what it is. 
        Trevors biggest help was the suggestion of using a mobile Jquery plugin for our website which enabled our website to automatically fit the dimensions of all/most mobile devices and helped our website work better for mobile devices.
        <br><br>
        Our lecturer DR.B however, did not provide the same amount of feedback or consolidated guidance as our mentor Trevor. 
        We obviously didn’t see Dr.B as frequently as we saw Trevor, however we found that Trevors advice and guidance was much more specific and useful towards the development of our project, 
        whereas, we found DR.B’s advice, much more generalised and so we therefore preferred to see Trevor for the desired help and guidance. 
        Our processes of communication were mostly in voice calls to each other. 
        Often when we were doing big chunks of work at a time, most if not all of us would join a voice call and work together as a group, where we are able to easily help one another and share feedback and ideas. 
        This process worked very well and efficiently and effectively as we were able to capitalize on each other's feedback instantly. 
        When smaller chunks of work were done individually, we would usually meet right before our meetings with our mentor to share what we’ve done and we would then incorporate Trevors feedback with each other's feedback prior to the mentor meeting and that feedback would help us develop the project. 
        Since the start of the semester we have mostly used this process throughout all assignments and we believed that it has worked well and effectively. 
        <br><br>
        The most important aspect of organising a project of this nature is to set out good plans, set out clear expectations, aims and goals and setting roles of group members. 
        These aspects are important and should be coupled with good communication from all members. 
        <br><br>
        If we were to redo this project from the start, we would choose a different project. 
        Although we liked the idea of our project, we found that it was very difficult for us to actually do. 
        As stated previously, we wanted the project to be an app rather than a website. However, as no one in the group has been taught any app development skills from DR.B /RMIT, we ended up not being able to develop the idea into an app and in the end had to transition into a mobile website. 
        This transition was met with negative criticism from DR.B. 
        Although Trevor understood and supported our transition, if we were to do this project again, we would not set out to do an app, as to avoid development issues. 
        <br><br>
        If another group were to embark on a similar project, our advice would be to plan out as much as possible, communicate well to one another and work on it as often as possible, no matter how small the progression may be. 
        Try to aim to work on it consistently, e.g. once a week. This consistent work can and will enable a higher level of success. 
        Working on it consistently allows for more frequent feedback and that feedback could then be used to improve the project processes and development. Communicating is also important to any group project as it welcomes feedback, 
        it allows others to seek assistance when needed, and having good communication lines enables the team to have good chemistry with one another and in turn work together effectively and efficiently.
